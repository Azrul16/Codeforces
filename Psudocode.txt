    1.Create a stack to hold operators.
    2.Create an output string to hold the postfix expression.
    3.Scan the infix expression from left to right.
    4.If the next character is an operand, append it to the output string.
    5.If the next character is an operator:
       While the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is an operator with higher or equal precedence than the current operator:
            Append the top of the stack to the output string.
            Pop the top of the stack from the stack.
       Push the current operator onto the stack.

    6.If the next character is a closing parenthesis:
        While the top of the stack is not an opening parenthesis:
            Append the top of the stack to the output string.
            Pop the top of the stack from the stack.
        Pop the opening parenthesis from the stack, but do not append it to the output string.

    7.Repeat steps 3-6 until the end of the infix expression is reached.
    8.While the stack is not empty:
            Append the top of the stack to the output string.
            Pop the top of the stack from the stack.

    9.Return the output string.
